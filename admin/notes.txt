#INTERACTIVE MUSIC MIXER
##Next steps

We need to fix the following bugs:

- Allow only four instruments at a time. After adding the four instruments, switching or adding more instruments should be prohibited unless the user presses the "reset" button.

- Apply a page reset function on the "reset" button to reset all drag and drop instruments.

- Fix the error in the instruments div and position it by dragging the instrument. Other instruments must not descend or push other parts.
